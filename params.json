Our unique approach involves *interpreted formal proof dialogues*, which are an enhanced form of a kind of dialogue that we are all familiar with:\r\n\r\n- A first person or group, the proponent, puts forward an initial argument.\r\n- Other people or groups, the critics, respond with criticisms of the argument.\r\n- The proponent addresses the criticisms, possibly modifying their argument to accomodate them.\r\n- The process repeats: the critics respond with new criticisms of the modified argument and/or the proponentâ€™s response to their previous criticisms."
