	<h3 class='homepage-section-title'>Who We Are</h3>

	<p>Logic for Progress is a non-profit that aims to advance the quality of deliberation on contentious social issues by researching and facilitating the application of formal logic. We believe that logicians and mathematicians have a role to play in improving the caliber of law, learning, and public discourse. We have developed Structure Together, a web-based collaboration tool to facilitate a unique process involving <emph>interpreted formal proof dialogues</emph>, which are an enhanced form of dialogue that we are all familiar with:
</p>

	<ul>
		<li>A first person or group, the proponent, puts forward an initial argument.</li>
		<li>Other people, the critics, respond with criticisms of the argument.</li>
		<li>The proponent addresses the criticisms, possibly modifying their argument to accomodate them.</li>
		<li>The process repeats: the critics respond with new criticisms of the modified argument and/or the proponent’s response to their previous criticisms.</li>
	</ul>

	<p> Though Logic for Progress is already several years in the making, developement of this page has only just started. Until there is more here, <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~wehr/thesis/index.html">these PhD thesis materials</a> are the best source for more information.</p>

	<h3 class='homepage-section-title'>What We Are Doing</h3>

	<p>We are currently in the process of improving the user-interface of the web-tool, Structure Together.</p>

<p>Beginning in the new year, we will be embarking on a number of case studies applying formal logic to a wide range of issues. If you have an idea for a topic that would have impact in your community, or if you have mathematics or formal logic skills and would like to volunteer, email <a href="mailto:dustin.wehr@gmail.com?Subject=[LFP]%20Customize%20subject%20or%20leave%20as-is,%20but%20keep%20%27[LFP]%27" target="_top">Dr. Dustin Wehr</a>.</p>


<h3 class='homepage-section-title'>What We Believe</h3>

<p>The most important problems for society are presently discussed in a highly rhetorical manner intended to persuade, or in a highly obtuse manner that can only be understood by specialists. In either case, it is difficult to differentiate between fact, assumption, and logic. In this ambiguous light, the biases and misconceptions we all possess have too great an opportunity to exert themselves. In order to reduce their influence in significant and difficult decisions, we must use methods that force them to be examined openly.</p>

<p>In law and public policy, we should be putting our best efforts into a reasonable and thorough conversation, as free from prejudice as possible. Formal logic, the science of correct reasoning, has been developed over centuries and has the potential to transform the way we reason about contentious issues. Logic for Progress seeks to make the application of logic accessible, while researching its utility in legal, policy, and public contexts.</p>

<p>We have developed a surprisingly-accessible, web-based software tool, Structure Together. This program simplifies the collaborative creation of LfP’s main product: <emph>interpreted formal proof dialogues</emph>. An interpreted formal proof is an argument whose objective, logical part is verified correct by an automated program, and whose fundamental, real-world concepts and entities are defined in plain English. To scrutinize an IFP, a reader need only focus on the claims, assumptions and informal definitions. A patient reader does not need a background in mathematics to understand an ideal IFP, in which the assumptions are relatively simple even though the automatically-verified derivations are complex. That ideal, however, is only achieved after a process of collaborative scrutiny, criticism, and revision, which is what interpreted formal proof dialogues are for. They are used for two things: (1) to challenge claims and assumptions, and (2) to force the authors to strengthen the precision of their informal definitions of fundamental concepts and entities. The Structure Together web app makes this process practical and accessible, and allows for remote collaboration.</p>

<p>In applying this method to social issues, we are able to provide a clear separation between one’s logical reasoning and one’s claims and assumptions. This clarifies the fundamental points of contention and focuses the conversation, reducing the impact of rhetoric on the outcome of major social and legal decisionmaking. Prior to the foundation of Logic for Progress, this method was tested on a smaller scale in the <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~wehr/thesis/index.html">doctoral work</a> of Dr. Wehr. It has been applied to physician assisted suicide, a gender discrimination lawsuit, wrongful conviction cases, and arguments from analytical philosophy.</p>

<p>While the software is specifically designed to be accessible to those without a background in mathematics, it does require someone with mathematical maturity to be involved in the process. This is a new and very rare opportunity for collaboration between the fields of (proof-based) mathematics and the humanities. It provides career and volunteer opportunities for mathematicians, logicians, and computer scientists who currently have no outlet for using their knowledge and skills toward social betterment.</p>


	<!-- <h2>FAQ</h2>
	<div class="faq-question">
		<div>Q: Does the Logic for Progress process help to make good decisions?</div>
		<div>
			<p>A: It depends. The process makes it <em>much</em> harder to settle on <em>bad</em> decisions, but also at least somewhat harder to settle on good decisions. Because of the latter point, it is appropriate only for certain kinds of problems. 
			<p>The process is most appropriate when the consequences of making a bad decision are great, and difficult or impossible to rectify. Some examples: 
				<ul>
					<li>Executing an innocent person<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Todd_Willingham">1</a>,...todo more</sup>, and much more commonly, depriving an innocent man of decades of his freedom. </li>
					<li>Failing to convict a person guilty of a violent crime who is likely to reoffend.<sup><a>2</a></sup></li>
					-->
					<!-- <li>Under-regulating an industry, new product, or service.</li> -->
					<!-- <li>Under-regulating a dangerous new technology.</li> -->
					<!-- <li>Over-regulating a beneficial new technology.</li>  -->
					<!-- <li>Approving a dangerous new drug.</li> -->
					<!-- <li>Delaying the approval of a safe and uniquely beneficial drug.</li> -->
					<!--
					<li>Under-regulating an industry that pollutes the environment.</li>
				</ul>			
			</p>
			<p>Conversely, the process is least appropriate when time and resources for deliberation are very limited, when the consequences of a bad decision can be mitigated, and when bad decisions produce new data that can be used to make a more-informed decision.

	<!-- It's great for isolating fundamental sources of disagreement and revealing hidden assumptions - including your own hidden assumptions.
It's great for gaining a better understanding and appreciation of your opponents' positions.
And it can also be used to demonstrate, in the most humble and scrutinizable way possible, that something very unreasonable in going on. -->
