	<span class='lfp-hideable'>
	<p>
	We carry smartphones that rival supercomputers of days past. We’re witnessing the birth of space tourism and driverless cars. A surgeon can replace your knees with titanium and have you walking around the next day. And yet, it seems that we have made no overall progress, in a hundred years, on how we deliberate and decide on the most important problems for society. When we discuss and debate the most critical and contentious issues (those related to justice, economics, health, environment, war, etc) we do so either in a highly rhetorical manner intended to persuade, or in a highly obtuse manner that can only be understood by specialists. In either case, it is difficult to differentiate between fact, assumption, and logic. The biases and misconceptions we all possess, even the most conscientious of us, have too great an opportunity to exert themselves. In order to reduce their influence in significant and difficult decisions, we must use methods that force them to be examined openly.
	<!-- The most important problems for society are presently discussed in a highly rhetorical manner intended to persuade, or in a highly obtuse manner that can only be understood by specialists.

	</p>

	<!-- <p>In law and public policy, we should be putting our best efforts into a reasonable and thorough conversation, as free from prejudice as possible. Formal logic, the science of correct reasoning, has been developed over centuries and has the potential to transform the way we reason about contentious issues. Logic for Progress seeks to make the application of logic accessible, while researching its utility in legal, policy, and public contexts.</p> -->

	<!-- <p>We have developed a surprisingly-accessible, web-based software tool, Structure Together. This program simplifies the collaborative creation of LfP’s main product: <emph>interpreted formal proof dialogues</emph>. An interpreted formal proof is an argument whose objective, logical part is verified correct by an automated program, and whose fundamental, real-world concepts and entities are defined in plain English. To scrutinize an IFP, a reader need only focus on the claims, assumptions and informal definitions. A patient reader does not need a background in mathematics to understand an ideal IFP, in which the assumptions are relatively simple even though the automatically-verified derivations are complex. That ideal, however, is only achieved after a process of collaborative scrutiny, criticism, and revision, which is what interpreted formal proof dialogues are for. They are used for two things: (1) to challenge claims and assumptions, and (2) to force the authors to strengthen the precision of their informal definitions of fundamental concepts and entities. The Structure Together web app makes this process practical and accessible, and allows for remote collaboration.</p>

	<p>In applying this method to social issues, we are able to provide a clear separation between one’s logical reasoning and one’s claims and assumptions. This clarifies the fundamental points of contention and focuses the conversation, reducing the impact of rhetoric on the outcome of major social and legal decisionmaking. Prior to the foundation of Logic for Progress, this method was tested on a smaller scale in the <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~wehr/thesis/index.html">doctoral work</a> of Dr. Wehr. It has been applied to physician assisted suicide, a gender discrimination lawsuit, wrongful conviction cases, and arguments from analytical philosophy.</p>

	<p>While the software is specifically designed to be accessible to those without a background in mathematics, it does require someone with mathematical maturity to be involved in the process. This is a new and very rare opportunity for collaboration between the fields of (proof-based) mathematics and the humanities. It provides career and volunteer opportunities for mathematicians, logicians, and computer scientists who currently have no outlet for using their knowledge and skills toward social betterment.</p> -->

	<h3 class='homepage-section-title'>Our Approach - Formal Deductive Deliberation</h3>
	<span class="show-hide-trigger fa fa-li lfp-shown"'></span>
	<span class='lfp-hideable'>

	<p>
Logic for Progress is distinguished from similar deliberation-facilitating efforts on the web <span class='trig'></span><span class='collapsed'><a href='http://cci.mit.edu/deliberatoriumresearchpage.html'>Deliberatorium</a>, <a href='http://carneades.github.io/'>Carneades</a></span> by its use of formal logic, specifically predicate logic, to constrain what counts as a valid argument, and to define the rules of <em>Formal Deductive Deliberation</em> (FDD), which are aimed to forbid or penalyze behaviors, which we're all familiar with, that so often block progress in debate on contentious issues.
	</p>

	<!-- If the <a target='_self' href='#promises'>promises above</a> were straightforward to deliver on, you would know about Formal Deductive Deliberation (FDD) already.  -->
	 <!-- Keep that it mind as you read this section. -->
	

	<p>
	Usage of FDD starts with a document, called an Interpreted Formal Proof, which lays out some reasoning in support of a position. The reasoning must conform to certain standards, which are checked automatically by software. The main component of the standards is formal deductive logic<!-- [popup note: some more background <a>here</a> - we do NOT advise that you read an introduction to formal logic] -->, which makes the standards close to what mathematicians use when they prove theorems about numbers/geometry/physics/etc. We use the standards for the same reasons that mathematicians do - to make it easier to find and correct flawed reasoning. <!-- || An FDD practitioner uses them for the same reasons that mathematicians do - to make it easier for themself and their peers to spot flawed reasoning. --> 
	</p>

	<p>
	Of course, unlike in mathematics, contentious issues are rife with vagueness and subjectiveness, and uncertainty. And crucially, we understand fully that those difficulties cannot be eliminated completely <span class='trig'></span><span class='collapsed'>unlike movements in analytic philosophy such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_positivism">Logical Positivism</a></span>. Definitions cannot be settled on before reasoning begins; rather we must tolerate vagueness and gradually sharpen definitions only as-necessary during the course of our reasoning. Finding a reusable, common moral framework before attempting to compromise is equally infeasible; instead, we must constantly reason about our opponents' subjective beliefs, as well as our own. Even when uncertainty <span class='trig emph'></span><span class='collapsed'>arguably a kind of subjectiveness -- about the likelihood of events and the consequences of partial and errorful knowledge</span> is the only problem, so that we can utilize the crucial ideas of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_statistics">Bayesian Statistics</a>, it is impossible to analyze all possibly-relevant factors in one argument; rather, we need a system that helps to regulate how new factors are introduced into an argument, especially to protect from delaying tactics.

	This is why the full program of Formal Deductive Deliberation involves <em>Interpreted Formal Proof Dialogues</em>, an enhanced form of dialogue that we are all familiar with, where:

	<ul>
		<li>A first group, the proponents, put forward an initial argument. </li>
		<!-- <li>(Any number of) people and teams of people, the critics, respond with criticisms of the argument. </li> -->
		<li>Others, or the proponents themselves (when scrutinizing one's own reasoning)<!-- <span class='trig'></span><span class='collapsed'>when one is scrutinizing one's own reasoning</span> -->, respond with criticisms of the argument. </li>
		<li>The proponents address the criticisms, possibly modifying their argument to accomodate them.</li>
		<li>The process repeats: the critics respond with new criticisms of the modified argument and to the proponents’ responses to their previous criticisms.</li>
	</ul>
	Often such dialogues break down well before they become productive. Almost always, they are not productive in a lasting way except possibly for the partcipants themselves, so that negligible progress is made for society as a whole. Interpreted Formal Proof Dialogues are designed to avoid such wasted efforts, by encouraging progress in any of several forms:
	</p>

	<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Some fundamental source of disagreement is found, often involving morality, which wasn't apparent before the dialogue began. Future dialogues can start from there.</li>
		<li>Some line of argument is formally proved to be flawed or fruitless. The proof can be reused in later dialogues.</li>
		<li>The disagreement is found to hinge on differing guesses about the likelihood of future events or events from the past that we have too little decisive information about. There is almost always some element of this. It is the major difficulty in our ongoing work on wrongful conviction.</li>
		<li>The partcipants find that the disagreement was not a disagreement at all, instead being a result of the different sides using words in different ways. Much of modern professional philosophy falls into this category, but there are incentives to not recognize that, since the ongoing disagreements support careers in the field. </li>
	</ul>

	stick with just the Mr Big propositions. bringing in anything else is more complicated than it seems.

	In the case we're looking at now, the defence presented an alibi for Burns and Rafay that put them on the other side of town when the murders happened. Obviously the jury was not convinced by the alibi witnesses, presumably believing they were either lying or mistaken. The prosecution would be happy to use the simplifying assumption that the witnesses were lying or mistaken. But unlike with the possibility of the officer being a sadist, the defence wants to argue that there's a significant chance that the alibi is legitimate. It turns out that there's a standard way of proceeding in situations like this, called Bayesian Analysis, but we won't need to get into the details of that. The bottom line is that both sides agree:

	</p> -->
	<!-- <p class='centered-par'>
	In some cases of murder similar to this one, with a similar alibi, (a) the witness is telling the truth, and in other such cases, (b) the witness is wrong (intentionally or unintentionally). 
	<p/>
	<p>
	What matters is the frequencies of (a) and (b). That's where probabilities come in. Both sides will assume something about how often (a) and (b) happen in cases like this. For example, "(a) happens at most 1% of the time and (b) happens at least 99% of the time" would be a strong assumption that benefits the prosecution. The defense would be wise, in such a case, to use the rules of Formal Deductive Deliberation to try to challenge that assumption

		<div>Q: Does the Logic for Progress process help to make good decisions?</div>
		<div>
			<p>A: It depends. The process makes it <em>much</em> harder to settle on <em>bad</em> decisions, but also at least somewhat harder to settle on good decisions. Because of the latter point, it is appropriate only for certain kinds of problems. 
			<p>The process is most appropriate when the consequences of making a bad decision are great, and difficult or impossible to rectify. Some examples: 
				<ul>
					<li>Executing an innocent person<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Todd_Willingham">1</a>,...todo more</sup>, and much more commonly, depriving an innocent man of decades of his freedom. </li>
					<li>Failing to convict a person guilty of a violent crime who is likely to reoffend.<sup><a>2</a></sup></li>

					<!-- <li>Delaying the approval of a safe and uniquely beneficial drug.</li> -->
					<!--
					<li>Under-regulating an industry that pollutes the environment.</li>
				</ul>			
			</p>
			<p>Conversely, the process is least appropriate when time and resources for deliberation are very limited, when the consequences of a bad decision can be mitigated, and when bad decisions produce new data that can be used to make a more-informed decision.

	<h3>blurbs</h3>
	 <p>Logic for Progress conducts case studies using the methodology of Formal Deductive Deliberation (FDD), with the aim to influence real decision making. We also develop a tool to ease the burden of FDD; humans are not hard-wired to think in a primarily deductive manner, and certainly not to use formal logic, so there are serious barriers to overcome. There is a lot of work to be done before FDD is accessible enough to be used in a public institution.

	<br/><br/>

	<h3>Mr Big</h3>
		We care a lot about miscarriages of justice at LFP, and they make for good case studies (more on why later), so we'll use a possible wrongful conviction as an example:

		<div id='position'>
		Position: "There is a significant chance that Atif Rafay and Sebastian Burns falsely confessed to murdering Rafay's family in 1995(?)."
		</div>
		<br/>

		These two Canadian men were extradited by Canada after a Mr. Big sting tricked them into confessing to murdering Burns's family. A Mr. Big Sting is an elaborate, expensive, months-long undercover operation that involves fooling a murder suspect into thinking they are being brought into a crime syndicate, all for the purposes of eventually eliciting a confession to the murder. I'll let the CBC's Fifth Estate explain more fully:

		<blockquote>
			Mr Big as it’s carried out today was invented primarily by the BC RCMP in the early 1990s. The operation involves undercover cops forming a phony criminal gang to solve murders (usually cold cases). After months of studying a suspect's daily activities, an undercover officer posing as a gang member “accidentally” befriends the suspect. Next, the suspect is offered easy odd jobs with the criminal such as driving a car from one city to another, or making bank deposits. The suspect is paid up to thousands of dollars for these tasks. Eventually, once the suspect trusts the gang, they are introduced to the crime gang’s boss - Mr. Big. Mr Big tells the suspect that in order to stay on good terms with the gang (and the easy money that comes along with it) they must confess to a past crime. Mr. Big offers to help make any incriminating evidence linking the suspect to that crime disappear, but only if the suspect is straight with him and confesses in full detail. The RCMP always videotapes this meeting using a hidden camera. Once the suspect confesses, they are arrested and charged a few days later. The RCMP says Mr. Big operations have resulted in 350-400 arrests. Critics say the operation is little more than entrapment. The sting is illegal in many other countries, including the United States.
		</blockquote>

		We're going to give an extremely simple (and thus easy to attack) argument for the <a target='_self' href='#position'>Position</a>. Only for the sake of keeping this short, we'll be ignoring all the evidence involved in the Burns/Rafay case except for the confession to Mr. Big. Doing -- this is actually unfavourable for the two men, because the rest of the evidence, taken together, points toward their innocence (but don't take my word for it; <a href=''>click here</a> to be notified when we've completed a more-comprehensive Interpreted Formal Proof for this case).

		<!-- <p>
		QA machine. Takes a Thing as input, and outputs "Good", "Bad", or "Inconclusive". 
		</p> -->
		<p>
		There are a lot of questions about the crime and the Mr. Big sting that we'll never know the answers to for sure. <!--Some of these things, though they would be helpful, don't necessarily need to be taken into account to make an argument that the defendent is probably guilty or not. -->
		For example, we don't know <i>for sure</i> that Officer X is not a sadist intent on seeing innocent men convicted. But there are some convincing (though falsifiable) reasons to believe he's not, for example that nobody is claiming he is. And, when we consider how complicated analyzing this case would be if we had to doubt the basic virtue of the officers (see OJ Simpson case), we come to the conclusion that we're all ok just assuming Officer X is not a sadist. This is one trick we use to reason when we don't have all the relevant knowledge: both sides (prosecution and defence) agree to take as true something that neither knows <i>for sure</i> is true. It's called a "simplifying assumption" in engineering and science.

		Simplifying assumptions for answering unknown questions should be used whenever possible, but often they cannot, because the proponent of the argument and the critic of the argument will have different guesses about the answer, and the {Position} strongly depends on the answer. In those cases, each side must formulate its own assumptions that imply an answer to the question. In the simplest case the assumption is their desired answer itself, and the whole argument becomes conditional on that guess being correct. But that makes the argument very weak. For example, we could assume that if the two men are innocent, they would definitely have falsely confessed. We could then conclude that the Mr Big evidence is as worthless to the prosecution as the men's claims of innocence are to the defense. That is a much stronger conclusion that we need to get a judge to reject the evidence, and it came at the cost of making an assumption that is too hard to justify. What we can do instead is make both the assumption and conclusion weaker. Moreover, if the language we use to state our assumption can also be used to state an assumption that the prosecution would accept, then we will be in a good position to argue with the prosecution. One way of doing this is to partially quantify our uncertainty about the question by introducing a probability parameter with the following property:
		<ul>
		<li>There is at least one parameter setting that constitutes an answer to the contentious question that satisfies us, the proponent.</li>
		<li>For each critic in the {intended audience}, there is at least one parameter setting that constitutes an answer to the contentious question satisfies the critic.</li>
		</ul>
		This allows us to say things like "(I believe) there's at least a 20% chance that the defendent's alibi witness is honest." The intended meaning of the "20% chance" in that sentence is underspecified, and can be sharpened in various natural ways. Philosophers love to argue about which way is "the best", and they've been doing it for decades, with the different ways broudly grouped into "frequentist" and "Bayesian". Luckily for the philosophers, there is no "the best" way, and so their arguments will never come to an end, supporting careers in philosophy for decades to come.
