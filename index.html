# Logic for Progress

Logic for Progress is a project and aspiring nonprofit organization devoted to improving the quality of deliberation on serious issues. Our unique approach involves interpreted formal proof dialogues, which are an enhanced form of a kind of dialogue that we are all familiar with:

- A first person or group, the proponent, puts forward an initial argument.
- Other people or groups, the critics, respond with criticisms of the argument.
- The proponent addresses the criticisms, possibly modifying their argument to accomodate them.
- The process repeats: the critics respond with new criticisms of the modified argument and/or the proponentâ€™s response to their previous criticisms.
